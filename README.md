# terraform-docker
Integration between Terraform and Docker.

This project is intended for people who want to build their docker images from terraform.

## Getting Started

### Usage

Here is a simple example of `main.tf` file that build an image named `test:latest` 
based on the Dockerfile specification. When you use `null_resource` changing something to the command does not trigger the re-execution if the command worked and the first place. To solve this problem we have to change the identifier or change the image value.

```
locals {
  region  = "my-region"
  zone    = "my-zone"
  project  = var.project
}

# Specify the GCP Provider
provider "google" {
  project  = local.project
  region   = local.region
  zone     = local.zone
}

# local-exec for building the docker image
resource "null_resource" "building_docker_image" {
  triggers = {
    image_id = var.image_id
  }
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<EOF
      docker build -t test:latest .
    EOF
  }
}
```
Here is a simple example of variables.tf file, you can specify another image value changing the default value or running the following command `terraform apply -auto-approve -var image_id=kong_dbless`.

```
variable "image_id" {
    type = string
    default = "test"
}
```

### Steps to use the entrypoint version
> Only accepts terraform commands

You have to create a [Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/) to store the files that we will use to build the container. Let run init for terraform first.

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/:/workpace -w /workpace terraform-docker:0.1 init
```

Then we have to mount [docker socket](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36185035/how-to-mount-docker-socket-as-volume-in-docker-container-with-correct-group) as volume in docker container. 

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/:/workpace -w /workpace -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock 
 terraform-docker:0.1 apply -auto-approve
```

### Steps to use the standard version
> You can run bash based in ubuntu and terraform commands

Run init.

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/:/workpace -w /workpace terraform-docker:0.1 "terraform init"
```

Run apply

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/:/workpace -w /workpace -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock 
 terraform-docker:0.1 "terraform apply -auto-approve"
```

### Cloud Build

Here is a simple example of `cloudbuil.yaml` file that invokes the `terraform-docker` image to execute your tasks.

```
- name: 'gcr.io/project-test-270001/terraform-docker:0.1'
  id: init
  args: ['init']
```

## Acknowledgments
This image was born when we wanted to manage the infrastructure with terraform and we required 
to build a docker image for a project but it was not possible because the terraform image does not have docker.

Please tell others about this project. üì¢
